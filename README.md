# The_Game

This is my attempt to recreate the game Tetris.

I wanted to challenge myself, and use this ambitious project as a test to see if I could complete a large-scale project on a deadline.

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete my project due to some syntax errors that I was unable to resolve.

I was able to get as far as creating the gameboard aka the "grid" as well as the tetrominoes and their rotations. But when it came to getting the tetrominoes to
appear on the screen, I was unable to manuever past this hurdle in time.

I intend to come back to this code and revise it over time, in an attempt to develop my skillset further, and improve upon my troubleshooting.

The current code is what I have so far.
